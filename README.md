Links and Resources:
Used paletton.com for CSS color palette and css-tricks.com for general CSS help. All images were sourced from "free to use and share" google image results.

Reflections and Comments:
Redid the javascript to use arrays and loops. Wanted to use one array for all 7 questions but couldn't figure that out in time so
I made the 6th and 7th questions independent. 
Could use mo betta CSS. Couldn't figure out how to center an image in between other things.
